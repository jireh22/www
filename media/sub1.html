				<p>Woody has always been confident about his place in the world and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that’s Andy or Bonnie. But when Bonnie adds a reluctant new toy called “Forky” to her room, a road trip adventure alongside old and new friends will show Woody how big the world can be for a toy. </p>

				<p>As one of the works that changed the history of animation and film industry, starting with the success of this animation, the traditional 2D production method gradually becomes a trend, and 3D CG animation becomes a trend in the animation film industry. It is also a deeper and larger animation in that it is not only a transition to 3D, but also a work that deeply captures family love, friendship, love, and childhood innocence.
                    Since it is an animation with toys, many people think it is childish just by looking at it, but it is evaluated as one of the masterpieces of Pixar's works, and each has a clear philosophy and theme. Toys' conversations and way of speaking are also high-quality. For this reason, you need to get some age to fully understand the content and lessons. Of course, it is a work that children can enjoy enough.

						<dt>A Toy’s World View</dt>
						<dd>Part of the magic of the “Toy Story” movies is getting to view the world from a toy’s perspective. “‘Toy Story’ has a caricatured world where everything is designed from the toy’s point of view,” says director Josh Cooley. “We really wanted to expand the world as much as possible. So, going outside of the tri-county area was huge. And we put the toys in places that they’d never been—places that would have new types of toys that would present new problems.”

                            While the look of the films is stylized, advancements in technology led to new opportunities. “With each film, our technology gets better and better, and we’re able to make things look more believable, more realistic,” says Cooley. “In this movie, there are shots that are staggeringly realistic. At times we have to pull it back—it’s too real. One thing we learned from the first three films was to keep the lighting to more stage-like so that it feels presentational.” </dd>

						<dt>The Antique Store</dt>
						<dd>According to Production designer Bob Pauley, the antique store is vast and filled with thousands of objects. “We did a lot of research,” he says. “For ‘Ratatouille,’ they went to Paris. For ‘Up,’ they went to Venezuela. But for ‘Toy Story 4,’ we stayed close and visited local antique stores. We discovered a lot of charming, interesting and fun people running them, and many visual similarities from store to store. There’s often a stoplight, a juke box, sometimes a big plastic Santa and of course lots of collectables and real antiques. There are many lights and lamps illuminating all the items throughout the store—lights connected to lots and lots of extension cords and power strips. The front desks are always interesting, small notes, little curiosities, extra tags and refreshingly low tech: they laboriously hand-write receipts and chat about your purchase. There’s also a cat or two that have the run of the place, so we incorporated one to help tell our story.</dd>

						<dt>Carnival</dt>
						<dd>According to Screenwriter and Executive Producer Andrew Stanton, the idea of a carnival conjured many ideas when it came to new characters. “If you think about it, a carnival has the cheapest, saddest, most disposable toys known to man,” says Stanton.

                            Cooley adds that the setting itself provided endless opportunities for the toys to explore those areas unseen by humans. “We want the toys to go places we can’t,” says Cooley. “They walk the roofs of the game booths, along the giant power cords on the ground and even into the middle of the carousel. And it just looks beautiful.”
                            
                            Pauley and other artists went to several carnivals to gather reference. “We wanted to capture the charm of carnivals—the bright candy colors, the lights, the obligatory Ferris wheel, all the rides and game booths,” he says. “We learned how they function, how they are designed and work. Few will notice all the details, but together, they help build a world that just feels right.”</dd>
